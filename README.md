#AKH-Dienst-plugin 🕰️ RetroSite Refresher

> Bringing the 90s meduniwien web into the 2020s — one frameset at a time.

## ✨ What is AKH-Dienst-plugin?

AKH-Dienst-plugin is a Chrome/Firefox-compatible browser extension that takes your old, crusty, frameset-loving website and gives it a fresh, modern look. Think of it as a facelift for legacy sites — no more endless nested scrollbars or hunting through tiny frame windows.

And it doesn’t stop at a glow-up. We added a bunch of features to make your experience *actually* usable again.
